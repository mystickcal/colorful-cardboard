If you grade Pokemon cards, you already know the only thing that matters is the spread.

Raw price vs graded price, minus grading fees, minus shipping, minus time.

PSA updated submission pricing in February 2026 (effective **February 10, 2026**), and even small changes here can flip a "grade it" into a "sell it raw" real fast. This post is the quick, practical version: what changed, what I'm doing differently, and the clean rules that keep you from grading yourself into a loss.

If you want the bigger baseline first, read this: **[Pokemon Card Grading Turnaround Times February 2026: PSA vs BGS vs CGC](/posts/pokemon-card-grading-turnaround-times-february-2026/)**.

## What actually changed with PSA pricing in February 2026

PSA's fee structure is always moving, but the important part for collectors is simple:

- The cheapest tiers got less forgiving.
- The "grade everything" strategy got worse.
- The cards that still make sense to grade are the same type of cards as before, you just need a higher raw value and a higher confidence in a top grade.

More specifically, the big stuff people felt right away:

- **Bulk Value moved behind Collector's Club** (so you cannot just toss a pile in at the lowest price without a membership).
- **The cheapest Value option got more expensive** (Value is now $25 per card).
- The old **$20 return option is gone**, so if you were living in that tier, your grading math just changed.

If you were previously grading borderline cards at the low tier and hoping for a 10, this is where you start bleeding money.

## The new grading ROI rules I'm using (Pokemon-specific)

I'm not trying to be cute with spreadsheets. I want rules I can follow at a table at league night.

### Rule 1: If you're not chasing a 10, stop grading modern

On most modern cards, PSA 9 is basically the "nice, but meh" bucket. You can still sell it, but you often do not get paid for the fee and the wait.

So my default is:

- **Modern (Scarlet and Violet era)**: grade only if it has a real shot at PSA 10.
- **Vintage**: PSA 8 and PSA 9 can still be fine, depending on the card.

If you are new to pre-grading, start here first: **[How to Grade Pokemon Cards: PSA vs BGS vs CGC](/posts/how-to-grade-pokemon-cards-psa-vs-bgs-vs-cgc/)**.

### Rule 2: Your raw price floor needs to be higher now

The old "$50 raw might be worth grading" logic was already shaky. With higher fees, I want a bigger cushion.

My updated floor for PSA submissions in 2026:

- **$80 to $120 raw minimum** for most modern chase cards, and only if you think it can 10.
- **$200+ raw** if you are not 100% confident in condition, or if centering looks even slightly off.
- **$300+ raw** if you are paying for faster service because you are racing a hype window.

That sounds strict, but it saves you from sending 20 cards and getting back 17 PSA 9s that you cannot move without discounting.

### Rule 3: Do not grade "maybe" centering

Centering is the silent killer. A card can look pack fresh and still come back 9 because the borders are off.

If the centering is questionable, I do one of three things:

- **Sell raw** while the card is hot.
- **Hold raw** if I like it long-term and I do not need a slab.
- **Send to BGS** only if I genuinely think the card is pristine and I want the ceiling outcome (and I accept the risk).

## When PSA still makes sense (even after the price change)

PSA still wins for liquidity. Buyers search PSA, comps are clean, and it is the easiest slab to sell.

It still makes sense when:

- You have a clean modern chase that should 10.
- You have a vintage card where PSA is basically the market language.
- You are protecting yourself from counterfeits on a high-dollar card you plan to sell online.

Counterfeits are not going away, and if you buy raw online, this guide is worth having open in another tab: **[How to Spot Fake Pokemon Cards Online (2026)](/posts/how-to-spot-fake-pokemon-cards-online-2026/)**.

## The "PSA vs BGS vs CGC" move in 2026

Here's the way I think about it right now:

- **PSA**: best when you want the easiest resale and the most predictable comps.
- **BGS**: best when the card is actually elite and you want that "perfect" upside.
- **CGC**: best for budget grading and personal collection slabs, especially if you are not optimizing for max resale.

If you want the longer breakdown and how to pick for your situation, read: **[How to Grade Pokemon Cards: PSA vs BGS vs CGC](/posts/how-to-grade-pokemon-cards-psa-vs-bgs-vs-cgc/)**.

## The simple submission strategy that protects you

This is what I do when I'm tempted to "just grade it":

1. Check raw price today.
2. Check PSA 10 sold comps, not listings.
3. Assume you get a 9 unless you can prove 10.
4. Subtract all costs: grading fee, shipping both ways, supplies, platform fees when you sell.
5. Ask one question: "Would I still do this if the card drops 15% while it's at PSA?"

If the answer is no, I sell raw.

## Cards that are still great grading candidates in 2026

These are the categories that still work:

- **Modern alt arts / SIRs / chase ex** that are already $100+ raw and clean.
- **Event promos** (low supply, lots of collectors, fast demand spikes).
- **Japanese exclusives** that carry collector premium and grade well.
- **Vintage WOTC holos** that are clean enough to grade high.

And if you are building a long-term hold box, do not forget the boring part: storage. A raw card that stays clean is an option, a raw card that gets scuffed is a regret. This is the storage setup I use: **[Pokemon Card Storage Guide (2026)](/posts/pokemon-card-storage-guide-2026/)**.

## FAQ

### Should I rush to submit before PSA changes pricing again?

Only if you already have cards that clearly fit your grading rules. Panic-submitting borderline cards is how you lose money.

### Is PSA still the best for modern Pokemon cards?

For resale liquidity, yes. If you are chasing the absolute ceiling on a flawless modern card, BGS can be worth considering, but it is a different bet.

### What if my card is expensive but I think it only grades a 9?

On modern, I usually sell raw unless the card is so high-end that authentication alone is worth it. On vintage, PSA 9 can still carry strong premiums.

### How do I know if I have a PSA 10?

You never "know", but you can get close. The biggest modern killers are centering, tiny corner whitening, and surface dents. Pre-grade under bright light and be brutal with yourself.

### What's the biggest mistake people make after a price increase?

They keep grading the same pile of "pretty good" cards and assume the outcome stays profitable. Fees go up, margins go down, and suddenly the same behavior is a loss.

## Bottom line

PSA pricing changes do not kill grading. They just punish sloppy grading.

Be pickier, raise your raw-value floor, and act like PSA 9 is the default outcome on modern cards. If you do that, grading is still a great tool in 2026, and you will stop donating fees to the grading companies.
