Okay so look if you're sitting on some raw Pokemon cards right now wondering whether to send them in for grading you know the FIRST question is always how long is this gonna take because grading turnaround times can make or break whether something is worth grading especially with prices moving as fast as they do in this market.

I've been tracking grading turnarounds for the past few months and just got some cards back myself so here's the real deal on PSA versus BGS versus CGC as of February 2026 and what I'm actually seeing in terms of wait times and whether it's worth it or whatever.

## PSA Grading Turnaround Times (February 2026)

PSA is still the king you know they command the highest premiums on graded cards especially for vintage stuff but their turnarounds have been ALL over the place the last couple years and right now here's what I'm seeing:

**Value tier ($25/card, 65 business day guarantee):** Actually coming back in like 50-55 business days which is pretty solid you know that's about 10-11 weeks and for most modern cards this is the sweet spot unless you're in a rush or whatever.

**Regular tier ($40/card, 40 business day guarantee):** Hitting closer to 35-40 business days so like 7-8 weeks and honestly if you've got cards you think are gonna grade PSA 10 and are worth $200+ this is probably where you want to be because an extra $15 per card to shave 3-4 weeks off the wait can make a difference if prices are climbing.

**Express tier ($75/card, 10 business day guarantee):** Still consistently hitting 8-10 business days which is FAST but at $75 a pop you better be grading stuff that's worth at least $500-1000 raw or it doesn't make financial sense and I mean I've used this tier for chase cards from new sets where timing matters but for most collectors it's overkill.

**Super Express ($150/card, 3 business day guarantee):** I haven't used this personally because holy shit $150 per card but the reports I'm seeing say it's actually hitting 2-3 business days consistently and this is for like if you pulled a $2000+ alt art and you want it slabbed and listed on eBay before the market cools off or whatever.

## BGS / Beckett Grading Turnaround Times

Beckett has always been the go-to for modern cards where you're chasing that elusive BGS 10 / Black Label and their turnarounds have actually been FASTER than PSA lately which is kinda surprising you know:

**Economy ($20/card, 45 business day service level):** Coming back in like 40-45 business days so roughly 8-9 weeks and this is solid for bulk modern submissions where you're not in a rush.

**Standard ($30/card, 20 business day service level):** Hitting 18-22 business days consistently which is about 3.5-4 weeks and honestly this is where I've been sending most of my modern chase cards lately because the speed-to-cost ratio is better than PSA's Regular tier.

**Express ($100/card, 5 business day service level):** Pretty reliably 5-7 business days and yeah it's expensive but if you're chasing a Black Label on a card that could be worth $5K+ it starts to make sense.

The thing with BGS is you know their population reports are way smaller than PSA so a BGS 10 on the right card can command insane premiums but for vintage stuff PSA still rules the market so you gotta know your audience and all that.

## CGC Grading Turnaround Times

CGC is the newer player and they've been AGGRESSIVELY competitive on both pricing and turnaround which has won them a lot of market share especially with people who are tired of waiting for PSA:

**Standard ($15/card, 30 business day maximum):** Actually hitting 20-25 business days consistently which is like 4-5 weeks and at $15 a card this is the cheapest option by far if you're doing bulk modern submissions.

**Express ($25/card, 5 business day maximum):** Coming back in 5-7 business days and for modern cards where you just want a slab and don't necessarily need the PSA premium this is a STEAL compared to PSA Express at $75.

**Premium ($70/card, 1 business day maximum):** I haven't tested this but reports say it's legit hitting 1-2 business days and it's half the price of PSA Super Express so if you need something turned around FAST and CGC's brand is acceptable for your buyer pool this could be the move.

The knock on CGC is that their slabs don't command the same resale premiums as PSA or BGS you know a CGC 10 might sell for 60-70% of what a PSA 10 would get on the same card but if you're grading for personal collection or long-term hold that might not matter and the cost savings and speed are legit.

## What's Actually Worth Grading Right Now?

Okay so turnaround times are one thing but the real question is like what cards should you even be sending in because grading fees add up fast and if you're spending $25-40 per card you need to be pretty confident it's gonna grade well and the value increase justifies the cost.

**Modern chase cards (alt arts, full arts, secrets)** from recent sets like Ascended Heroes, Perfect Order, Prismatic Evolutions — if you pulled something that's worth $100+ raw and you think it's a strong 9 or 10 candidate then yeah absolutely grade it because the multiplier on high-grade modern cards can be 2x-3x raw value.

**Vintage WOTC holos (Base Set through Neo)** especially first editions — but ONLY if they're in really clean shape you know a PSA 9 Charizard is worth way more than a raw near-mint one but a PSA 6 Charizard might actually be worth LESS than keeping it raw because collectors would rather have a nice raw copy than a mid-grade slab.

**Event promos and tournament rewards** like the upcoming EUIC 2026 Hisuian Typhlosion promo or Pokemon Day promos — these are low-population by nature and if you can get them graded early while pop reports are still tiny you're positioning yourself well for long-term value.

**Japanese exclusive cards and high-end modern Japanese** — the Japanese market loves graded cards and PSA 10s on Japanese exclusives can command huge premiums especially stuff from limited print runs or special promo releases.

## What I'm NOT Grading Right Now

**Bulk modern cards from unlimited print sets** unless they're legit chase cards — like standard holos and Vs and GXs from widely-printed sets aren't worth the grading fees because even a PSA 10 might only be worth $20-30 and you're spending $25-40 to grade it so the math doesn't work.

**Anything in worse than near-mint condition** because you're just throwing money away you know a PSA 6 or 7 on most cards actively HURTS resale value versus keeping it raw unless it's an ultra-high-end vintage card where any grade adds some legitimacy.

**Cards I'm not confident will grade 9+** because the market for PSA 8s and below has basically collapsed on modern cards and even on vintage the premium for an 8 versus a nice raw copy isn't worth the wait and fees in most cases.

## Real Talk on Grading Costs vs Returns

Here's the thing nobody wants to say out loud you know grading companies have done an AMAZING job convincing collectors that everything needs to be slabbed but the reality is most cards don't benefit enough from grading to justify the cost and time especially with current turnarounds.

If you've got a $50 raw card and you spend $25 to grade it and it comes back a PSA 9 (which is NOT a 10) you might end up with a card worth $60-70 and you just spent $25 plus shipping both ways plus 6-8 weeks of time to make a $10-20 profit and that's assuming it grades 9 and not 8 which would probably LOSE you money.

So my rule of thumb is this: Don't send anything for grading unless the card is worth at least $75-100 raw AND you're confident it's got a real shot at a 9.5 or 10 AND the graded comps show a clear 2x+ multiplier over raw prices because anything less than that and you're better off just keeping it raw or selling it raw and reinvesting the money into something else.

## Which Grading Company Should You Use?

**For vintage cards (WOTC era, 1999-2003):** PSA all day every day because that's what the market values and a PSA 10 Base Set Charizard sells for way more than a BGS 10 or CGC 10 on the same card even though the actual grading standards are pretty similar.

**For modern chase cards where you're going for a perfect 10:** BGS if you think you've got a Black Label candidate (which is like finding a unicorn but when it hits it HITS) or PSA if you just want the safest resale value.

**For bulk modern submissions where speed and cost matter:** CGC hands down because $15 per card with 4-5 week turnarounds beats everyone else and if you're grading stuff for your personal collection or long-term hold the brand difference doesn't matter as much.

**For super time-sensitive stuff:** BGS Standard ($30, 3-4 weeks) has been the sweet spot for me lately because it's faster than PSA Value and cheaper than PSA Regular and the slabs still carry good resale value on modern cards.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if my card will grade 10?

You don't lol that's the brutal truth but here's what to look for: perfect centering (50/50 front and back, use a ruler), zero whitening on corners (use a jeweler's loupe), clean edges with no nicks or rough spots, surface completely free of scratches or print lines, and no holo scratches if it's a holo card. Even then you might get a 9 because grading is subjective and sometimes cards that look perfect to the naked eye have micro-flaws that get caught under the grader's magnification.

### Is PSA 10 really worth that much more than PSA 9?

On modern cards YES absolutely the gap between a 9 and a 10 can be 2x-5x depending on the card because everyone wants that perfect grade and 10s are way rarer than you'd think. On vintage cards the gap is smaller because 10s are SO rare that most collectors are happy with high-grade 9s but even then a PSA 10 vintage holo commands a huge premium.

### Should I crack and regrade cards that came back lower than expected?

Sometimes yeah if you genuinely think the card deserved better and the grading fee is worth another shot but you're gambling that you get a different grader with different standards and there's no guarantee it doesn't come back the same grade or even LOWER. I've cracked and resubmitted a few cards that I thought were clear 10s that came back as 9s and gotten 10s on the second try but I've also had them come back 9 again so it's a risk.

### Can I speed up my submission by paying more after I already submitted?

Nope once it's submitted it's locked into that service level so if you sent something in at Value tier and then the market starts spiking you're stuck waiting out the full turnaround. This is why I sometimes pay up for Regular or Express tier on cards I think might move fast even if it feels like overkill at the time.

## The Bottom Line

Grading turnarounds in February 2026 are pretty reasonable across the board compared to where they were in 2021-2022 when PSA was shut down for months and backlogs were insane but you still gotta be smart about what you send in because grading fees add up FAST and most cards don't benefit enough to justify it.

PSA is still king for vintage and high-end modern, BGS is the play if you're chasing perfect 10s on modern cards, and CGC is the budget-friendly option for bulk or personal collection grading where speed and cost matter more than maximum resale value.

And remember you know just because you CAN grade a card doesn't mean you SHOULD because a nice raw card in a toploader is often more liquid and easier to sell than a PSA 8 that nobody wants and you've sunk $25-40 into.

Grade the chase cards, keep the bulk raw, and don't fall for the trap of thinking everything needs to be slabbed because the market has spoken and low-to-mid-grade slabs on common cards are basically worthless right now.
