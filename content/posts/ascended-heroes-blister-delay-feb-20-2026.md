The Pokémon Company just pushed the Ascended Heroes Erika and Larry 2-pack blisters to February 20 in the US and Canada. Originally slated for an earlier launch, this delay compresses the product rollout window and could make launch week pickups trickier than usual.

Here's what collectors need to know about the shift, what's in these blisters, and how to handle the tighter release schedule.

## What's in the Erika and Larry Blister Packs

Each 2-pack blister includes one exclusive promo card (either Erika's Tangela or Larry's Komala depending on which blister you grab), one collectible coin featuring the character artwork, and two Ascended Heroes booster packs.

The promos are the main draw here. Erika's Tangela and Larry's Komala are both Gym Leader-themed cards that fit the nostalgia angle Ascended Heroes leans into. Tangela features updated artwork of Erika with her signature Grass-type partner, while Komala shows Larry in his laid-back style.

These aren't tournament staples, but they're solid collector pieces if you're building a Gym Leader binder or chasing the full promo set.

## New Release Timing: Feb 20 and a Staggered Rollout

The official US and Canada street date is now **February 20, 2026**. That's the same day other Ascended Heroes products hit shelves, including Elite Trainer Boxes and booster bundles.

But here's where it gets messy: The Pokémon Company announced a staggered product rollout from **February 20 through April 24**. That means some items will be available immediately while others trickle out over the next two months.

According to [IGN's coverage](https://www.ign.com/), the 2-pack blisters are part of the initial wave on Feb 20, but supply allocations are tighter than previous sets. Retailers are getting smaller shipments of these SKUs compared to the ETBs and booster boxes.

If you're planning to grab these on launch day, expect limited shelf space and faster sellouts at big-box stores like Target and Walmart.

## Why This Delay Matters for Collectors

### 1. Launch Week Scarcity

Cramming multiple product types into the same street date creates bottlenecks. Collectors who want the blister promos *and* an ETB or booster bundle will be competing for limited stock on the same day.

Local game stores typically get better allocations of specialty items like blisters, but even they're reporting tighter inventory windows for Ascended Heroes. If you're planning to shop at an LGS, call ahead or check their social media for pre-order windows.

### 2. ETB and Booster Bundle Price Pressure

With everything launching on Feb 20, resellers are already listing pre-orders at inflated prices. [Ascended Heroes ETBs](/posts/ascended-heroes-etb-price-check-feb-2026/) are showing markups of 30-50% above MSRP on secondary markets.

The blister packs are less expensive (MSRP around $9.99-$12.99 depending on retailer), but that also makes them impulse buys for scalpers. Expect eBay listings to jump in the first 48 hours if brick-and-mortar stores sell out quickly.

### 3. Preorders Are Getting Tighter

Major online retailers like GameStop and Best Buy have already closed or limited pre-orders for Ascended Heroes products. The blister packs specifically have been harder to lock down because they're often bundled into "accessory" categories that don't get the same pre-order visibility as ETBs or booster boxes.

If you see a pre-order link for the Erika or Larry blisters at MSRP, grab it. Waiting until launch day is riskier this time around.

## Where to Buy and How to Avoid FOMO

### Check These Retailers First

Your best shot for fair pricing is still local game stores, but Target, Walmart, and GameStop are worth checking early on launch day since they sometimes get allocations the online listings miss. Online marketplaces like Amazon, TCGPlayer, and eBay can work too, just be picky about seller ratings and avoid obvious price gouging.

If you're shopping online, keep an eye on the [eBay search for Ascended Heroes Erika Larry blisters](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=ascended+heroes+erika+larry+blister&mkcid=1&campid=5339142051&toolid=10001) and the [eBay search for Ascended Heroes ETB](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=ascended+heroes+elite+trainer+box+pokemon&mkcid=1&campid=5339142051&toolid=10001) listing as a quick price baseline.

### MSRP vs Resale: Know the Difference

Blister packs should be $9.99-$12.99 at major retailers. If you're seeing listings for $20+ in the first week, that's resale markup.

For context, [the most valuable Ascended Heroes cards](/posts/most-valuable-ascended-heroes-cards/) are pulling $50-$150 in early market data, but those are chase rares from booster packs, not the blister promos. Erika's Tangela and Larry's Komala are cool, but they're not $20-per-blister cool.

### Don't Panic Buy

Ascended Heroes isn't a one-and-done print run. The staggered rollout through April 24 means restocks are coming. If you miss launch day, check back with your local stores in early March. The initial frenzy will calm down, and you'll have better odds at MSRP pricing.

## Final Thoughts

The Feb 20 delay for the Ascended Heroes Erika and Larry blister packs tightens the launch window, but it's not a disaster. If you're hunting these for the promos, your best move is to line up a local game store pre-order or check big-box stores early on the 20th.

Don't overpay for launch day FOMO. These will restock, and the promos aren't commanding the kind of prices that justify panic buying.
