The Pokémon TCG Ascended Heroes expansion hit shelves on January 30, 2026, but the full product lineup is rolling out in waves through April. If you're trying to figure out when you can actually buy that Elite Trainer Box or whether the Tech Sticker Collection is worth tracking down, here's everything you need to know about the Ascended Heroes release schedule and which products deserve your money.

## Ascended Heroes Product Timeline: Feb 20 Through Apr 24

According to IGN's release schedule, Ascended Heroes products are staggering out over two months. The first wave launched February 20, 2026 with the Elite Trainer Box and specialty collections. Later waves bring delayed blisters and booster bundles through April 24.

Here's the current schedule based on available information:

**February 20, 2026:** Elite Trainer Box, Tech Sticker Collection (Charmander and Ghastly variants)

**March 2026 (dates TBD):** Two-pack blisters featuring Erika's Tangela and Larry's Komala promos

**April 24, 2026:** Booster Bundle

Keep in mind this timeline reflects currently announced dates. Retailers sometimes get stock early or late depending on distribution, so your local game store might have different availability.

## Product Breakdown: What You Get and Who Should Buy

### Elite Trainer Box ($49.99 MSRP)

The Ascended Heroes ETB is the flagship product and honestly the best all-around buy if you can find it at retail price. You get nine booster packs, 65 card sleeves, 45 Energy cards, damage counters, condition markers, a player's guide, six reference cards, a rules booklet, a collector's box, and a code card for online play.

This is for collectors who want a complete package and players who need the accessories. The ETB also tends to hold value better than loose booster packs. Right now they're selling for $115-120 on the secondary market, which tells you everything about demand.

If you see one at Target or GameStop for MSRP, grab it. You're getting roughly $50-70 in booster packs alone at current prices, plus all the extras.

### Booster Bundle (Releasing Apr 24)

The Booster Bundle gives you six booster packs in a compact package. No accessories, no frills, just packs. This typically retails around $24.99-29.99 depending on the retailer.

Who's this for? Players who just want to crack packs without paying for sleeves they don't need. The math works out to about $4-5 per pack, which is standard retail pricing. Not a great deal compared to buying a booster box (36 packs for $140-160), but convenient if you're buying at a big box store.

The April 24 release date is interesting. By late April, the hype around Ascended Heroes will have cooled off, so you might actually find these sitting on shelves. If you're patient and just want to open some packs for fun, this could be the most accessible product in the entire lineup.

### Tech Sticker Collection (Feb 20)

The Tech Sticker Collection comes in two versions: Charmander and Ghastly. Each includes three booster packs, a promo card (either Charmander or Ghastly with unique artwork), a sticker sheet, and a mini portfolio.

MSRP is typically $14.99-19.99. The promo cards are the main draw here. Early pricing on TCGPlayer shows the Charmander promo around $8-12 and Ghastly around $6-10, which means you're basically paying retail for three packs and getting the promo as a bonus.

This is for completionists who want the exclusive promo artwork. If you don't care about stickers or mini portfolios, your money goes further elsewhere. But if you're a Charmander collector or love Ghastly (who doesn't?), these are worth tracking down.

### Two-Pack Blisters: Erika's Tangela and Larry's Komala (March 2026)

These delayed blisters each contain two booster packs plus an exclusive promo card. Erika's Tangela and Larry's Komala are both Trainer's Pokémon promos, which historically appeal to fans of the characters.

At roughly $9.99-12.99 per blister, you're paying $5-6.50 per pack, which is higher than booster box pricing but includes the promo. Whether that's worth it depends entirely on how much you want these specific cards.

Larry's Komala has a shot at being the sleeper hit here. Larry became a fan favorite during Scarlet & Violet, and Komala is weird enough to have a cult following. If that promo gets any competitive play or meme status, prices could jump.

Erika's Tangela is pure nostalgia bait for fans of the classic Gym Leaders. Tangela isn't meta, but it doesn't have to be. Collector appeal matters more for these.

## What's Worth Buying: MSRP vs Market Markup

Let's be real about what you should buy at different price points.

**At MSRP (if you can find it):** Buy the Elite Trainer Box, no question. At $49.99, it's the best value in the entire product line. The ETB is currently reselling for $115-120 according to recent market data, meaning you're saving $65-70 by buying at retail. Even if you're not keeping it sealed, nine packs plus all the accessories justifies the price.

**At 20-30% markup:** The Tech Sticker Collections are still reasonable if you want the promos. Paying $20-25 for the Charmander version isn't terrible given the promo value. Same logic for the two-pack blisters at $12-15. You're overpaying slightly, but not getting destroyed.

**At 50%+ markup:** Skip everything except sealed ETBs if you're a long-term collector. Paying $75 for a Booster Bundle that should cost $29.99 is absurd. Paying $30 for a Tech Sticker Collection is equally ridiculous. Wait for restock or buy singles on TCGPlayer.

**Never worth it:** Paying $115-120 for an ETB unless you're a sealed collector who missed the initial wave. At that price, you're better off buying a booster box and getting 36 packs for $140-160. The math only works if you specifically want the sealed ETB for long-term hold value.

## If You See It In Stores: Quick Checklist

**Buy immediately:** Elite Trainer Box at MSRP ($49.99). Don't think, just buy.

**Buy if you're a collector:** Tech Sticker Collections (Charmander/Ghastly) at MSRP ($14.99-19.99). Promos are solid.

**Buy if you like the character:** Erika's Tangela or Larry's Komala blisters at MSRP ($9.99-12.99). Promos are niche but fun.

**Skip unless desperate:** Booster Bundle above $35. Just buy a booster box or wait for restock.

**Check TCGPlayer first:** If anything is marked up more than 30%, compare prices for singles. You might save money buying the exact cards you want instead of gambling on packs.

## FAQ

**When did Ascended Heroes officially release?**

Ascended Heroes launched January 30, 2026 with booster packs and booster boxes. The full product lineup (ETBs, collections, blisters, bundles) is releasing in waves from February 20 through April 24, 2026.

**What's the best Ascended Heroes product to buy for value?**

The Elite Trainer Box at MSRP ($49.99) is the best value. You get nine booster packs plus all the accessories, and it's currently reselling for $115-120 on the secondary market.

**Are the Tech Sticker Collection promos worth it?**

If you're a Charmander or Ghastly collector, yes. The promo cards are running $6-12 on TCGPlayer right now, which means you're getting them plus three packs for close to pack retail price. The stickers and mini portfolio are just bonuses.

**Why is the Booster Bundle delayed until April 24?**

No official reason has been given for the April 24 release date. It's likely a distribution strategy to spread out product availability and keep the set relevant for a longer period. The late release also means Booster Bundles might be easier to find in stores since hype will have cooled off.

If you find anything at MSRP, buy it now. ETBs especially are selling out fast. For products like the Booster Bundle releasing in April, you can afford to wait since they'll be more readily available later.
