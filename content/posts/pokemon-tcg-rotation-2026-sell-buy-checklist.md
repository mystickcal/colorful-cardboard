If you're sitting on competitive singles from Scarlet & Violet 151, Obsidian Flames, or Paldea Evolved right now, your window to sell at full price is closing fast. The 2026 Standard rotation hits Pokemon TCG Live on **March 26** and in-person play on **April 10**, and when player demand evaporates from a card, prices often follow within 2-3 weeks.

The key word is *player* demand. Not all rotation casualties are created equal. Some cards held up almost entirely by competitive play will drop 25-40% after April 10. Others, built on nostalgia, art quality, and collector appeal, will barely flinch. Knowing the difference is where the money is.

Here's the full breakdown: what's rotating, what to sell, what to hold, and what to buy once the dust settles.

## What's Actually Rotating Out on April 10

All cards with the **G regulation mark** exit Standard on April 10, 2026 (March 26 on Pokemon TCG Live). That includes most cards from these sets:

- **Scarlet & Violet Base Set** (SVI), released March 2023
- **Paldea Evolved** (PAL), June 2023
- **Obsidian Flames** (OBF), August 2023
- **Scarlet & Violet 151** (MEW), September 2023
- **Paradox Rift** (PAR), November 2023

Also rotating: any card with a G regulation mark that was reprinted in later sets, like some Charizard ex reprints in Paldean Fates, if the reprint still carried the G mark.

This is a big rotation. These five sets combined represent roughly a year of competitive product. The meta staples that have kept card prices elevated, think draw supporters, energy acceleration, and tank attackers, are all leaving at once.

For players, that's exciting. Fresh format. For investors holding competitive-heavy cards, it's a sell signal.

## The Sell List: Offload These Before March 26

These are cards where competitive play demand is carrying a significant chunk of the market price. Once those players dump their copies before rotation, you don't want to be the one holding.

**Target sell window: now through March 20.** Digital rotation hits March 26, and competitive players sell 1-2 weeks ahead of that to avoid the price cliff.

| Card | Set | Est. Current Price | Why Sell |
|------|-----|-------------------|----------|
| Charizard ex (Tera) 223/197 | Obsidian Flames | ~$220-230 (TCGPlayer, Feb 2026) | Competitive staple, Tera Charizard ran in multiple decks. Pure collector demand won't hold this price post-rotation. |
| Gardevoir ex 245/193 (SIR) | Paldea Evolved | ~$55-70 | Anchor of Gardevoir ex decks for 2 years. Post-rotation demand craters. |
| Iono 185/182 (SIR) | Paldea Evolved | ~$35-50 | Meta-defining supporter. Gets reprinted eventually, AND rotates. Double pressure. |
| Sandy Shocks ex 230/182 (SIR) | Paldea Evolved | ~$20-30 | Post-rotation, competitive demand evaporates. Niche collector appeal only. |
| Iron Valiant ex 89/182 | Paldea Evolved | ~$15-20 | Strong competitive play usage. Low collector ceiling on ex cards. |
| Roaring Moon ex 124/182 (SIR) | Paradox Rift | ~$25-35 | Competitive play kept this elevated. Modest collector interest, not enough to hold price. |
| Iron Thorns ex 230/182 (SIR) | Paradox Rift | ~$15-25 | Same pattern, competitive driver, minimal collector premium. |
| Charizard ex 006/165 (Paldean Fates, G mark) | Paldean Fates | Check TCGPlayer | If your copy has a G mark, it rotates too. Verify your version. |

The common thread on the sell list: cards where player demand is doing heavy lifting, without enough nostalgic or art-driven collector demand to compensate after rotation. Gardevoir ex has been the backbone of one of the best decks in Standard for two years. Once it rotates, watch how fast player copies flood the market.

Check eBay sold listings for recent comps before pricing, TCGPlayer market price can lag behind real sales data by 3-7 days.

## What to Hold: Collector Pieces That Rotation Won't Touch

These cards from the same sets have strong enough collector or nostalgia demand to weather the rotation without major price drops. Hold or even consider accumulating post-rotation if prices dip slightly.

| Card | Set | Est. Current Price | Why Hold |
|------|-----|-------------------|----------|
| Charizard ex 199/165 (SIR) | Scarlet & Violet 151 | ~$230-288 | Charizard + 151 nostalgia = collector magnet. Rotation won't kill demand for a Charizard card that looks this good. |
| Mew ex 205/165 (SIR) | Scarlet & Violet 151 | ~$60-85 | 151 is a pure collector set, every card has the first-gen nostalgia premium baked in. |
| Blastoise ex 200/165 (SIR) | Scarlet & Violet 151 | ~$40-60 | Same 151 nostalgia floor. Starter trio SIRs hold collector value long-term. |
| Alakazam ex 201/165 (SIR) | Scarlet & Violet 151 | ~$35-55 | Psychic nostalgia + beautiful art. Pure collector hold. |
| Charizard ex 215/197 (SIR, dark art) | Obsidian Flames | ~$225+ | This one is tricky. The dark Tera art is legitimately gorgeous. Collector premium is real. Watch prices closely, if competitive pressure was holding it above its collector ceiling, it dips. If collector demand is primary, it holds. I'm watching, not selling blindly. |

The 151 set is special because it was never really about competitive play. It was designed as a nostalgia product for collectors. Every card in the set has the original 151 Pokemon front-and-center. That demand doesn't rotate. Current prices on [TCGPlayer](https://www.tcgplayer.com) reflect this, 151 SIRs have been climbing since December lows, *despite* rotation approaching.

## The Buy List: What to Snag After the Rotation Dip

Here's the counterintuitive move: rotation creates buying opportunities in *non-rotating* cards. Here's why.

When players dump rotating cards, they use that cash to upgrade their post-rotation decks. Demand spikes for the cards they need. But there's also a second effect: collector attention and money shifts toward the newest shiny thing, in this case, Perfect Order (March 27 release) and the Ascended Heroes product cycle.

That temporary capital shift means some attractive non-rotating cards dip or stay flat while everyone else is distracted. That's your window.

**Buy targets in the post-rotation window (March 27, April 20):**

- **Perfect Order SIRs (Week 2 entry, April 3-10)**: The [most valuable Perfect Order cards](/posts/most-valuable-perfect-order-cards-2026/) launch March 27 at inflated prerelease premiums. Week 2, right as rotation hits in-person play on April 10, is historically the best singles entry point. Dual timing: Perfect Order hype settles + collector cash frees up from rotation sales = dip window. Look at Mega Zygarde ex SIR and Mega Clefable ex SIR specifically.
- **Ascended Heroes SIRs (10-20% dip when Perfect Order launches)**: When a new set drops, collector money shifts. [Ascended Heroes SIRs](/posts/most-valuable-ascended-heroes-cards/) typically dip 10-20% in the 2-3 weeks post-PO launch. Mega Gengar ex SIR at $836 dipping to $700? That's a buy if you believe in the set's long-term collector ceiling.
- **Post-rotation staples for the new meta (H/I/J legal)**: Competitive players will drive demand for deck-building pieces that stay legal. If you know what the top post-rotation decks will run, buying singles before the meta settles can be profitable. Check what survives from Twilight Masquerade, Stellar Crown, and Surging Sparks.

## The Two-Wave Timing Framework

This rotation creates two distinct sell windows, use them strategically.

**Wave 1: Digital rotation (March 26)**
The competitive player market moves first. TCG Live goes to the new format on March 26. Players who care about tournament legality on the digital platform start pricing their rotating cards 1-2 weeks early, so **March 10-20** is the ideal window to catch them before early sellers push prices down.

**Wave 2: In-person rotation (April 10)**
Paper players have 2 more weeks than digital players. This extends the sell window for some cards, but the digital rotation announcement (March 26) will send a psychological price signal to all sellers. Don't assume you have until April 10 to sell, assume March 26 is your effective deadline for any card that sees serious competitive play.

If you're uncertain whether your cards have competitive versus collector demand, ask one question: *Would someone buy this card to put in a deck, or to put in a binder?* Deck cards sell now. Binder cards can wait or hold.

The [2026 rotation guide on Colorful Cardboard](/posts/pokemon-tcg-standard-rotation-2026-guide/) has the full set-by-set breakdown if you want to double-check which specific cards carry G marks.

## Rotation Risk Factors: When This Goes Wrong

Before you dump everything with a G mark, consider what could disrupt this framework.

**Collector demand can surprise you.** Gardevoir ex SIR from Paldea Evolved has been a top-10 most popular Pokemon for decades. Even if competitive demand collapses, a subset of collectors will continue buying the SIR version for their Gardevoir binder. The price may not crater as much as expected.

**Reprints change everything.** If TPCi reprints Iono or Charizard ex in a future set (without the G mark), both the rotating and non-rotating versions get a ceiling effect. Keep an eye on set spoilers through April.

**Perfect Order hype could be so strong it absorbs all collector capital.** If PO launch is a blow-out, collector cash goes there instead of back into older sets. That could delay any post-rotation recovery in 151 or OBF cards.

**The nostalgia premium is real but hard to quantify.** I believe 151 collector demand holds. I'm less certain about Obsidian Flames collector floor. If you're not sure, take half profits now and hold the rest.

## Quick FAQ

**Does rotation affect card value for collectors?**
Only if competitive play was a major price driver. Pure collector cards (151 SIRs, Charizard nostalgia plays) are largely insulated from rotation. Competitive staples take the hit.

**When is the best time to sell before rotation?**
March 10-20 for competitive staples. The earlier wave of sellers hits right before digital rotation (March 26). Don't wait until April 10, you'll be behind the market.

**Do I have to sell everything with a G mark?**
No. Sort your cards into "competitive singles" vs "collector pieces." Competitive singles = sell window. Collector pieces = hold or buy more on dips.

**Will 151 cards hold their value?**
Based on the collector demand pattern and 30th anniversary tailwinds, the 151 SIRs look well-supported. Check current [TCGPlayer market prices](https://www.tcgplayer.com) for real-time comps before making any decision. If Charizard ex 199/165 is still trading near $230-280, that market is telling you collector demand is real.

**What sets are NOT rotating?**
Cards with H, I, or J regulation marks are safe through 2026. That includes Twilight Masquerade, Stellar Crown, Surging Sparks, Prismatic Evolutions, Destined Rivals, and the new Mega Evolution sets (Ascended Heroes, Perfect Order, Chaos Rising).

**Should I buy Perfect Order at prerelease?**
I'd wait for Week 2 (April 3-10). Prerelease pricing is always elevated, and the April 10 rotation creates a natural double dip window. More detail in the [Perfect Order investment guide](/posts/most-valuable-perfect-order-cards-2026/).

## The Bottom Line

You have roughly three weeks to act on competitive G-mark singles before the rotation sell wave compresses prices. The priority order:

1. **Sell now (March 10-20):** Competitive staples, Gardevoir ex, Iono SIR, Charizard ex Tera (OBF), Roaring Moon ex SIR. Use eBay sold listings to price accurately, then list on [TCGPlayer](https://www.tcgplayer.com) or eBay (use code `5339142051` campaign for eBay Partner Network tracking).

2. **Hold through rotation:** 151 SIRs (Charizard ex, Mew ex, Blastoise ex, Alakazam ex). Collector demand is real and rotation won't kill a nostalgia card.

3. **Watch for dips (April 3-20):** Perfect Order SIRs in Week 2, Ascended Heroes SIRs as PO launch competes for collector cash.

The rotation clock is ticking. Every day you wait, more competitive players get the same idea and start listing their copies. Price it right, move it fast, and redeploy the cash into the next opportunity, which, conveniently, lands on store shelves March 27.
