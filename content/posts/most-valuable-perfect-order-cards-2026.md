You've been burned before.

Maybe it was Mega Gengar ex SIR going from a $100 prerelease pull to $836 while you waited for prices to "settle." Maybe it was the opposite -- you panic-bought Paradox Rift singles at peak hype, watched them crater, and still have a spreadsheet tab you refuse to open. Either way, you know the feeling of arriving either too early or too late to a card market that moved without you.

Perfect Order drops March 27, 2026. The English prerelease window opens March 14. And here's what's different this time: the Japanese version of this set -- called Nullifying Zero -- launched January 23. That's five weeks of real sales data before a single English booster pack hits a store shelf.

I've been watching the Japanese secondary market since launch day. The data is telling a clear story. Let me share the framework that's guiding my own buying decisions.

## The JP Price Floor Model (Your New Mental Framework)

Before we get into individual cards, I want to give you something reusable for every set release from here forward.

Japanese sets almost always launch 6-8 weeks before their English counterparts. The Japanese secondary market gives you real price discovery before English hype inflates everything. Here's the pattern I've noticed across the last several Mega Evolution sets:

**JP comps = your entry floor.** Whatever the Japanese market settles at 2-3 weeks after launch is roughly what English cards will be worth long-term, once the release-day premium clears.

**English launch = the hype window.** English versions typically run 20-40% above JP comps for the first 2-3 weeks after release. This is when scalpers profit and where new collectors get burned buying at the top.

**Week 2 post-release is your singles buying window.** Secondary market supply increases as more packs get opened, panic sellers undercut each other, and the next shiny thing starts pulling attention. Prices haven't fully corrected yet, but the worst of the premium has bled off.

**The next-set announcement is your flip signal.** For Perfect Order, that's Chaos Rising -- releasing May 22, 2026. Collector budgets shift, and cards that were holding $80 start sliding toward $60 as attention moves. If you're buying Perfect Order singles as short-term flips, plan your exit before May.

Apply this to every set. You now have a framework, not just a list.

## Why Perfect Order Is a Small Set With Big Stakes

Perfect Order clocks in at just over 120 cards -- a noticeably smaller set compared to Ascended Heroes at 295. That matters for value concentration.

Fewer total cards in a set means fewer pull slots. Fewer pull slots means rarer chase cards per box. And with 30+ confirmed special illustration rares crammed into a 120-card set, the SIR density here is genuinely high. You're not pulling base SIRs as a booby prize -- they're legitimately scarce.

The other factor amplifying demand is the Legends: Z-A tie-in. Mega Zygarde, Mega Starmie, and Mega Clefable are all featured prominently, and the video game's fanbase doesn't overlap 100% with the card market. That means new buyers flowing in with pure nostalgia and hype money -- people who care about the Pokemon, not the pack math.

That's a demand spike with a predictable shape. It runs hot for 3-4 weeks, then levels off as video game buzz fades. Price accordingly.

## Tier 1: The Definite Chase Cards (Budget Accordingly)

### Mega Zygarde ex Mega Hyper Rare

This is the card. The Mega Hyper Rare format -- that gold foil treatment on the full-art card -- sold for around $700 on early eBay listings from the Japanese version. The Japanese market has since settled to roughly $333 USD based on Nullifying Zero secondary sales.

Here's my honest take: the $700 sale was a single premium transaction, probably a graded copy or an early auction with bidding competition. The Japanese floor of ~$333 is a better signal.

English launch? I'd expect the hype premium to push this to $400-600 in the first week. The collector ceiling is probably $500-700 long-term if the card stays in demand. This is scarcity-driven, not art-driven -- the MHR format is the rarest print in the set, full stop.

My plan: I'm not chasing this at English launch prices. If you want it, buy it in the first 48 hours before flippers eat all the supply, or wait 6 weeks for the secondary market to find its true level around $300-400.

### Mega Zygarde ex Special Illustration Rare

This one actually has better art than the MHR, in my opinion. The SIR format lets the artwork breathe in a way the gold foil treatment doesn't. Japanese comps are sitting around $90 raw.

Joseph Writer Anderson's analyst predictions put the English launch range at $200-300 once hype sets in. I think that's realistic for the first week. My target buy price is $150 or below -- which means either waiting until Week 2 post-release, or getting lucky at prerelease pulling it yourself.

If you're choosing between the MHR and the SIR for your collection, the SIR is the better long-term hold. Collector preference for artwork over rarity gimmicks is a pattern that's held up across the Mega Evolution series.

### Meowth ex Special Illustration Rare

No Japanese comp yet -- Meowth ex wasn't in Nullifying Zero in the same confirmed slot. Analyst projections for the English launch put this at $80-150.

I believe it. Meowth cards carry a premium that defies strict logic. Nostalgia for original-generation Pokemon is real money, and when you combine that with competitive deck viability -- and this Meowth ex has real deck inclusion potential -- you get sustained secondary demand. It's not a short-term flip target. It's the card your local card shop is going to have a graded copy of in a display case for years.

## Tier 2: Solid Mid-Range Holds

These cards aren't going to make you rich, but they're not losing money either if you acquire them at reasonable prices.

**Mega Starmie ex SIR:** Early fan reaction to the artwork was mixed -- some people thought the action-shot composition was awkward. That reaction faded quickly once better scans circulated. Expected range $50-100. If you like the art, $60 in Week 2 is a sound buy.

**Mega Clefable ex SIR:** This one has stacking appeal. Original-generation Pokemon, Fairy Zone ability that's actually interesting in current metas, psychic energy synergy. Expected range $40-80. The competitive angle gives this more staying power than pure-nostalgia cards.

**Rosa's Encouragement SIR:** Supporter SIRs have a consistent value floor. Rosa is a Black and White era character, and that nostalgia layer is real. Supporter cards with acceleration effects also have practical deck value even when the meta shifts. Expected range $25-50. I'd target this at $30 or below.

**Jacinthe SIR:** A Z-A character with a psychic healing effect. Niche, stylish, and the kind of card that holds a moderate price long-term because it's not chased aggressively but also doesn't flood the market. Expected range $20-40.

---

## Tier 3: Buy Cheap, Not at Launch Prices

I'll be honest about the traps here, because I've fallen into them.

**Charizard IR and Gengar IR:** They're in the set. They were always going to be in a Mega Evolution set. And they will be inflated at launch, just like they always are, because Charizard and Gengar listings get clicks. Give it 4-6 weeks. These will find their natural price, and it will be lower than launch week.

**General Illustration Rares (9+ confirmed):** Beautiful cards. Genuinely. But supply is meaningfully better than SIRs, and patient buyers will find these at reasonable prices within 30-60 days of release. Set yourself a ceiling -- under $10 each after the first month -- and don't move on these at launch.

The completion trap is real: trying to buy every Illustration Rare at launch is the most expensive way to collect this set. I've done it. It's a bad feeling when the card you paid $25 for is available for $8 two months later. Prioritize your top 2-3 chase targets and let the rest come to you.

## What Japanese Nullifying Zero Prices Tell Us

Since the Japanese set launched January 23, we've had five weeks of real market data. Here's how I'm reading it as a predictive tool for the English market.

Mega Zygarde ex MHR: Japanese market settled around $333 USD after early hype cleared. That $700 eBay sale was almost certainly a graded specimen or an outlier auction. The floor is $333.

Mega Zygarde ex SIR: $90 Japanese raw comps. I expect English launch prices to run 20-30% above this before settling back.

The Ascended Heroes pattern is the best historical comparison we have right now. Japanese Ascended Heroes SIR prices served as a reliable floor for what English versions eventually settled at. English launched 30-40% above JP levels, ran hot for 2-3 weeks, then gravity pulled prices back toward the JP comp floor. I'd plan for the same here.

One honest caveat: Perfect Order has stronger video game hype than Ascended Heroes did at launch, because Legends: Z-A is actively being played right now. That could mean the hype premium holds slightly longer. I'm not banking on it, but I'm keeping an eye on it.

## Prerelease Strategy: Your Buying Windows

Prerelease runs March 14-22, 2026. This is the earliest opportunity to open packs at something close to MSRP.

The secondary market during prerelease weekend will be thin. Few packs opened means few singles available, which means any SIR or chase card that does surface gets priced aggressively. This is the worst time to buy singles. It is potentially a fine time to buy sealed if you're planning to hold for 6+ months -- but even that requires conviction that the set appreciates rather than depreciates sealed.

My personal prerelease plan: play events, enjoy the experience, keep any SIRs I pull. Not buying singles until at least Week 2 post-release (approximately April 3-10), when inventory has normalized and the initial launch premium has bled off.

**If you're buying sealed for investment:** Launch week is genuinely your best window. Before collectors and scalpers absorb supply, before MSRP disappears from local game stores. After that, sealed prices only go up if demand holds, and most sets don't see sealed appreciation for 12-24 months.

**If you're buying singles:** Wait for Week 2. Almost always. The only exception is if you have a specific card you need urgently for a deck -- and even then, the premium you pay for immediate availability has a dollar value you should think about consciously.

A practical budget framework: $100 cap for prerelease sealed (participate and enjoy), $200 reserved for Week 2 singles targeting your top 2-3 chase cards. Everything else goes on a watchlist with price alerts.

## What Perfect Order Means for Ascended Heroes Prices

This is the cross-set angle nobody covers, so let me spell it out.

When Perfect Order releases, collector attention and budget will shift toward the new set. Ascended Heroes SIRs that were holding steady will typically see a 10-20% price dip in the week after Perfect Order launches -- not because the cards got worse, but because discretionary money moved.

That dip is a buying opportunity.

If you missed Ascended Heroes SIRs at launch pricing, the Perfect Order release window is when you can likely acquire them at a discount. Target the week of March 27 through April 10 for Ascended Heroes singles.

Going the other direction: Perfect Order is a smaller set than Ascended Heroes -- fewer packs in circulation means SIRs stay scarcer longer. The supply ceiling is lower, which supports value retention better than a larger print run would. If you're comparing investment quality between the two sets, Perfect Order's smaller size is a real advantage for SIR holders.

And looking ahead: Chaos Rising releases May 22, 2026. The same dynamic will play out -- Perfect Order SIRs will see modest downward pressure as budget shifts again. If you're a flipper, that's your exit window. If you're a collector, it doesn't matter.

## FAQ

**What is the most valuable card in Perfect Order?**

Mega Zygarde ex Mega Hyper Rare. Japanese version has sold for up to $700, with the market settling around $333 USD for raw copies. English launch prices will likely run higher for the first week or two before correcting.

**Is Perfect Order worth buying packs at launch prices?**

At MSRP -- yes, especially if you enjoy the pull experience and the Mega Evolution theme. At inflated launch prices (scalped booster boxes, marked-up prereleases), no. The math doesn't work when SIR pull rates require hundreds of packs per expected hit. This is a singles set, not a rip-to-win set.

**When should I buy Perfect Order singles for the best price?**

Week 2 post-release, approximately April 3-10. Supply has normalized, panic sellers have undercut the launch premiums, and the worst of the hype tax has cleared. For ultra-budget targets, wait until Chaos Rising (May 22) shifts collector attention again.

**Will Meowth ex be expensive in Perfect Order?**

Projected $80-150 at English launch based on analyst estimates. I think it holds that range longer than most mid-tier cards because nostalgia demand for Meowth is persistent. It's not a speculative flip -- it's a collector card that will maintain value.

**How does Perfect Order compare to Ascended Heroes for card investment?**

Fewer total cards in Perfect Order means tighter SIR supply and better value retention per card. Ascended Heroes had more chase cards by volume, giving collectors more entry points. For concentrated value in a smaller number of cards, Perfect Order is the stronger bet. For diversified SIR exposure, Ascended Heroes still has the advantage of variety.

**What happens to Ascended Heroes prices when Perfect Order releases?**

Expect a 10-20% softening in Ascended Heroes SIR prices during the first 1-2 weeks of Perfect Order's launch as collector budgets shift. That dip is your buy window for Ascended Heroes cards you missed at launch. It won't last long.

The JP price floor model is the most underused tool in the English collector's arsenal. Five weeks of real sales data from Nullifying Zero is sitting there, and most buyers are still going to walk into prerelease weekend flying blind, paying hype premiums, and wondering why their singles are worth less six weeks later.

You don't have to be that buyer.

Set a budget, know your Tier 1 targets, wait for Week 2 on singles, and watch what Chaos Rising does to Perfect Order prices before you decide whether you're holding or selling. That's the whole playbook.
