Mega Gengar ex SIR is sitting at $836 raw. A PSA 10 of the same card in the secondary market is pushing into $1,200-$1,400 territory on eBay sold listings: roughly a 40-65% multiplier if you can land that grade.

The question every Ascended Heroes collector is asking right now: is it worth submitting? And more importantly: *which cards* are worth submitting?

The answer isn't the same for every card in the set. The math works out beautifully for two or three specific cards and falls apart completely for half the list. Here's how to think about it.

## Why March 2026 Is the Grading Window for Ascended Heroes

Timing matters more than most people realize when it comes to grading ROI on new sets. Here's the dynamic playing out right now with Ascended Heroes:

**Population counts are still low.** Ascended Heroes launched January 30, 2026. As of late February, PSA and BGS pop reports for the top SIRs are still relatively thin: we're talking hundreds of graded copies at most for the top cards, not thousands. Low population = premium pricing for existing slabs, because collectors pay up for scarcity.

**That window is closing.** As more people submit Ascended Heroes cards over the next 60-90 days, population counts will climb and the PSA 10 premium will compress. The earliest submitters capture the pop scarcity premium. Late submitters are just adding to the pile.

**Raw prices are still elevated.** The post-launch premium on Ascended Heroes SIRs is real. Cards like Mega Gengar ex ($836 raw) and Mega Charizard Y ex ($666 raw) are still in early price discovery. If you're buying raw now specifically to grade, you're paying hype-season prices: which changes the math significantly.

**The entry timing rule:** The best grading ROI scenarios right now involve cards you *already own* from breaking packs, or cards you can acquire at or below current TCGPlayer market. Buying raw at a premium specifically to flip a graded copy is a different risk profile.

## The ROI Framework: When Does Grading Actually Make Sense?

Before getting into specific cards, here's the mental model I use for grading decisions. A submission only makes sense when all three conditions are true:

1. **The raw card is worth at least $75-100 minimum** (PSA Value tier is $25/card as of the February 10, 2026 update: need enough upside to justify the fee plus 7-10 week turnaround)
2. **You're confident in a 9.5 or higher outcome** (PSA 10 on modern SIRs is achievable for near-mint copies, but an 8.5 or 9 on a $200 card barely breaks even after fees)
3. **PSA 10 graded comps show at least a 2x multiplier over raw** (some cards are graded more often for authentication than premium: not worth it unless the multiplier is there)

For Ascended Heroes specifically, I'm also adding a fourth condition: **submit before the population hits meaningful scale** (rough threshold: when PSA 10 copies of a given card exceed 500 graded, the pop scarcity premium starts compressing noticeably).

For a full breakdown of PSA's current fee structure and turnaround times, check out the [PSA grading pricing update from February 2026](/posts/psa-grading-price-increase-february-2026/): the fee math changed and if you're still using the old $20 Value tier in your calculations, you're underestimating your costs.

## Card-by-Card Breakdown: Submit or Skip?

Let's run the math on each major Ascended Heroes chase card. Raw prices sourced from TCGPlayer market (late February 2026 data). PSA 10 estimates based on eBay sold listings where available, or projected from raw + observed multipliers on comparable cards.

### Mega Gengar ex SIR (287/217)
**Raw price:** ~$836 NM  
**PSA 10 estimate:** $1,200-$1,400 (projected based on 40-65% graded premium)  
**PSA Value tier cost:** $25 + ~$15-20 estimated shipping/supplies  
**Break-even:** Raw + $40-45 in fees = ~$880 break-even floor  
**Upside if PSA 10:** ~$320-520 gain on a successful grade  
**Verdict: SUBMIT**: if you have a near-mint copy, this is the strongest grading ROI in the set. Gengar has proven collector staying power across multiple sets (Team Up, Fusion Strike, now Ascended Heroes). Pull rate is 1/2,000+ packs, so population will stay low longer than most SIRs. The 40-65% graded premium is real and documented.

The risk: an 8 or 8.5 grade on this card still returns roughly $650-750, which means you've lost money relative to selling raw. The card needs to be in genuinely excellent condition before you submit.

### Mega Charizard Y ex MHR (294/217, gold hyper rare)
**Raw price:** ~$666 NM  
**PSA 10 estimate:** $950-$1,100 (Charizard graded premium runs strong)  
**Break-even:** ~$710 with fees  
**Upside if PSA 10:** ~$240-390 gain  
**Verdict: SUBMIT**: Charizard slabs consistently command strong premiums and collector demand is deep. The gold hyper rare finish is harder to grade (foil damage risk): make sure your copy is truly clean before submitting. A lower grade here compresses the premium significantly. Gold hyper rares are more susceptible to surface scuffs from pack pulling, so condition-check aggressively.

### Mega Dragonite ex SIR (290/217)
**Raw price:** ~$555 NM  
**PSA 10 estimate:** $800-$1,000 (Dragonite has strong collector following, set poster-card status)  
**Break-even:** ~$600 with fees  
**Upside if PSA 10:** ~$200-400 gain  
**Verdict: SUBMIT if condition is excellent.** Dragonite doesn't have the cult collector base that Gengar does, and the price floor has more downside risk if the market softens. But at current prices, the math works if you're confident in the grade. I'd want a genuinely gem-mint copy before committing: not just a "looks good to me" raw.

### Pikachu ex SIR (277/217: gems design)
**Raw price:** ~$522 NM  
**PSA 10 estimate:** $750-$900 (Pikachu always commands a premium graded)  
**Break-even:** ~$565 with fees  
**Upside if PSA 10:** ~$185-335 gain  
**Verdict: SUBMIT**: Pikachu slabs are among the most liquid in the Pokemon market. If you need to sell a graded Ascended Heroes card in 12 months, a PSA 10 Pikachu will move faster than almost anything else in the set. The collector premium is real and durable.

### Mega Dragonite ex MHR (295/217, gold)
**Raw price:** ~$494 NM  
**PSA 10 estimate:** $700-$850  
**Break-even:** ~$535 with fees  
**Upside if PSA 10:** ~$165-315 gain  
**Verdict: SUBMIT with caution**: same gold hyper rare grading risk as the Charizard MHR. Condition is everything. The Dragonite collector base is solid but smaller than Charizard's. The math works if the card is pristine; submitting a borderline copy is a bad bet.

### Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex SIR (price per February KB data)
**Raw price:** ~$334 NM  
**PSA 10 estimate:** $500-$650 (Team Rocket nostalgia + Mewtwo premium)  
**Break-even:** ~$375 with fees  
**Upside if PSA 10:** ~$125-275 gain  
**Verdict: HOLD: watch the Destined Rivals launch first.** When Destined Rivals drops (May 30, 2026), Team Rocket card demand is going to surge hard. The raw price on this card could jump 20-40% before you'd even get a PSA submission back. Holding raw gives you flexibility to sell into that launch hype if prices run. Grade *after* you see how Destined Rivals impacts the market: or if you decide to hold long-term, submit in summer 2026 when the launch premium fades and you can acquire raw more cheaply.

### Lillie's Clefairy ex SIR (280/217)
**Raw price:** ~$249 NM  
**PSA 10 estimate:** $350-$450  
**Break-even:** ~$290 with fees  
**Upside if PSA 10:** ~$60-160 gain  
**Verdict: SKIP for now.** The upside is too thin relative to the risk of a lower grade. If this card grades a 9 instead of 10, you're looking at a $175-220 return on a $249 raw card: a loss after fees. Wait until raw prices pull back or PSA 10 comps firm up with more transaction data.

### N's Zoroark ex SIR (286/217)
**Raw price:** ~$170 NM  
**PSA 10 estimate:** $240-$310 (competitive utility adds demand but also adds risk of heavily played copies)  
**Break-even:** ~$210 with fees  
**Upside if PSA 10:** ~$30-100 gain  
**Verdict: SKIP.** The margin is too thin for the grading risk at current prices. N's Zoroark is competitive-play driven, which means a lot of these cards in the market have been shuffled repeatedly. Finding a truly gem-mint copy to submit is harder, and the PSA 10 premium is modest.

### Mega Feraligatr ex SIR (274/217)
**Raw price:** ~$202 NM  
**PSA 10 estimate:** $280-$360  
**Break-even:** ~$240 with fees  
**Upside if PSA 10:** ~$40-120 gain  
**Verdict: SKIP.** Similar story to Lillie's Clefairy: the margin is too compressed. If you pull one from packs and it's pristine, it might be worth a shot, but I wouldn't buy raw specifically to grade this card.

## The Timing Argument: Why "Soon" Matters More Than "Perfect Condition"

Here's something most grading guides don't talk about: timing your submission relative to population growth.

The Mega Gengar ex SIR has a pull rate of roughly 1/2,000 packs (based on community data from CardChill and 8,000+ pack aggregations). That means a lot of packs need to get opened before PSA 10 population gets large. Compare that to a more common SIR at 1/65 packs: population on those cards will grow 30x faster.

Low-pull-rate cards maintain their pop scarcity premium longer. That's why Mega Gengar ex is such a strong grading candidate even at its current elevated raw price: the graded supply will grow slowly, which supports the PSA 10 premium over a longer horizon.

For cards like N's Zoroark ex (more accessible pull rate, strong competitive demand driving immediate heavy play), population will grow quickly. The PSA 10 premium window is shorter.

See the [Ascended Heroes pull rates breakdown](/posts/ascended-heroes-pull-rates-rip-or-buy-singles/) for the full pull rate data by card: it's directly relevant to this timing calculation.

## What Grade to Target (And When to Settle)

PSA 10 is the target, but let's be realistic: the difference between a 9 and a 10 on a $200+ card is usually $50-150 in value. The difference between a 9 and a 10 on a $836 card can be $300-500.

My grading approach for Ascended Heroes SIRs:

**Only submit cards you'd be okay holding if they don't grade 10.** If a 9 grade turns a $836 card into a $700-750 slab (still a loss after fees and current raw price), you need to be comfortable with that outcome before you drop it in a submission box.

**Handle with gloves, sleeve immediately after pulling.** Ascended Heroes holos and SIRs are susceptible to surface marks from pack handling. Every card I'm considering for grading goes directly from pack to penny sleeve to toploader: no exceptions.

**Submit raw cards you already own, not cards you buy specifically to flip.** The math for "buy raw at hype prices, grade, sell PSA 10 for profit" is much tighter than it looks on paper once you factor in turnaround time risk (7-8 weeks), grading outcome variance, and market movement during your submission window.

For a full grading primer: service comparison, what grades are realistic on modern cards, and how to pack a submission: see [how to grade Pokemon cards (PSA vs BGS vs CGC)](/posts/how-to-grade-pokemon-cards-psa-vs-bgs-vs-cgc/).

## The Bottom Line

Two Ascended Heroes cards are clear submits right now: **Mega Gengar ex SIR** and **Mega Charizard Y ex MHR**. Both have the raw price, the collector depth, and the pull rate scarcity to support strong graded premiums that should hold even as population grows over the next 6-12 months.

**Mega Dragonite ex SIR** and **Pikachu ex SIR** are strong submits if you have pristine copies: the math works, just make sure condition is genuinely gem-mint before committing.

**Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex SIR** is a watch-and-wait situation: hold raw through the Destined Rivals launch (May 30) and reassess. You might be sitting on a card that runs to $500-600 raw before Destined Rivals ships, which changes the whole grading calculus.

Everything below $200 raw? Skip for now. The margins are too thin against PSA's $25/card fee and the very real risk of lower grades.

The window to submit Ascended Heroes cards with relatively low population counts is probably 60-90 days from now. After that, pop growth will start compressing the PSA 10 premium on all but the rarest pulls. If you're going to submit, submit soon: not next year.
