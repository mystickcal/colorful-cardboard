Rotation is one of the cleanest timing edges in Pokemon card collecting.

Pokemon confirmed the 2026 Standard timeline clearly:
- **March 26, 2026** for Pokemon TCG Live.
- **April 10, 2026** for in-person Play Pokemon events.

Cards with the **G** regulation mark rotate out. **H, I, and J** remain legal, plus future marks.

If you only remember one thing, remember this: rotation does not move every card the same way. It splits the market into winners, survivors, and dead inventory.

## Why Rotation Moves Prices So Fast

Competitive players retool decks on hard deadlines. That creates concentrated buying and selling windows.

Typical pattern:
1. 4-6 weeks before rotation, players start pruning likely cuts.
2. 2-3 weeks before rotation, buyers chase replacement staples.
3. First two tournament weekends after rotation, proven cards get another demand bump.

Collectors who act early get better entries and cleaner exits.

## Your 3-Bucket Rotation Plan

Use this exact structure for your binder and inventory sheet.

### Bucket 1: Sell Now (Likely Rotation Casualties)

These are cards whose demand is mostly Standard play and that do not have strong collector pull outside play.

Action:
- Move copies before March 26 when possible.
- Prioritize high-copy holdings first.
- Accept slightly lower prices to reduce downside risk.

### Bucket 2: Hold (Collector-Driven or Multi-Format Safe)

These cards can still hold value through rotation because demand is not only tied to Standard legality.

Examples include:
- Character favorites with strong art demand.
- Scarce promos with low supply.
- Cards with broad casual demand.

Action:
- Do not panic sell.
- Track sold comps weekly instead of daily.

### Bucket 3: Buy (Post-Rotation Utility Winners)

These are cards likely to gain share once old engines leave.

Action:
- Build a watchlist now.
- Buy in two to three entries, not one lump buy.
- Increase size only after early event results confirm usage.

## How To Identify Likely Winners Before April 10

Run this checklist on each candidate card:

1. It has synergy with legal marks H, I, or J support cards.
2. It fills a role that rotated cards used to cover.
3. It has enough supply to buy now, but not endless supply.
4. It appears in multiple credible testing lists.

If a card checks three out of four, keep it on your active buy list.

## Rotation and Ascended Heroes: Why They Intersect

Ascended Heroes legality is March 6, then digital rotation starts March 26. That gives a short window where testing pressure and rotation prep overlap.

That overlap can create sharp, short moves on playable singles.

## What To Buy and What To Avoid (Collector Version)

### Buy
- Playset targets that solve clear post-rotation deck gaps.
- Promos with both gameplay and collector demand.
- Sealed product only when pricing is near retail.

### Avoid
- Late buys after a card already doubled on hype.
- Deep positions in one unproven archetype.
- Heavy sealed buys at inflated premiums.

## Seasonal Timing Rules That Keep You Safe

Use these rules every rotation cycle:

- Rule 1: Sell obvious rotation losers in tranches, do not wait for the final week.
- Rule 2: Buy likely replacements before consensus forms.
- Rule 3: Keep 30-40% of budget in reserve for post-rotation confirmation buys.
- Rule 4: Recheck every target after first big tournament weekend.

This keeps you from chasing noise and helps you allocate into confirmed demand.

## Quick Weekly Workflow Until April 10

1. Sunday: update your watchlist and sold comps.
2. Tuesday: check new testing lists and community signals.
3. Thursday: adjust buy prices and position limits.
4. Saturday: execute only preplanned buys and sells.

Consistency beats impulse in rotation windows.
