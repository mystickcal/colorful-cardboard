I had thirty cards sitting on my desk last Tuesday. Modern hits from the last few months of ripping packs with my son. A couple of Prismatic Evolutions pulls that caught my eye, some Ascended Heroes promos, a handful of solid singles I'd picked up raw because the price was right.

I sat down to run the math on a PSA submission. And that's when I realized something had changed.

Not just the prices. PSA tweaked those effective February 10, 2026, and I'll walk through every number in a minute. The bigger shift is structural: the cheapest way to grade cards at PSA is now locked behind a paid membership. If you want Value Bulk pricing, you need a Collectors Club subscription. Period.

That turns grading from a per-transaction decision into a subscription decision. And those are two completely different kinds of math.

This article is the calculator I wish I'd had on Tuesday. Real break-even numbers. The hidden costs nobody includes. And a decision tree that tells you whether the membership saves you money or bleeds it, based on how many cards you actually submit in a year.

## What changed on February 10, 2026

PSA restructured their pricing tiers, and the part that matters most to Pokemon collectors is simple:

**Value Bulk** (previously accessible to everyone at a lower price point) is now **gated behind Collectors Club membership**. If you're not a member, your cheapest option is the **Value tier at $32.99 per card**. If you are a member, you get access to **Value Bulk at $24.99 per card**.

That's an $8 per card difference. Which sounds small until you multiply it by a real submission.

The membership itself comes in two flavors:

- **Standard**: $149 per year
- **Premium**: $199 per year

Both unlock Value Bulk pricing. Premium includes additional benefits (extra grading credits, exclusive access to certain events), but for this article, the math that matters is the price gap between $32.99 and $24.99 and whether you submit enough cards to justify paying $149 or $199 to access it.

One more thing that shifted: the old $20 Return option is gone. That was the cheapest way to get a card into a PSA slab, and losing it raises the floor for everyone. If you were using the $20 tier as your default for modern stuff, your per-card cost just jumped by at least $5 regardless of membership status.

For a deeper breakdown of every tier change, I covered the full pricing update here: **[PSA Grading Pricing Update (Feb 2026): The New Math for Pokemon Cards](/posts/psa-grading-price-increase-february-2026/)**.

## The break-even formula everyone should memorize

Here's the equation:

**Break-even cards = Membership cost / (Non-member price per card - Member price per card)**

For Standard membership:

$149 / ($32.99 - $24.99) = $149 / $8.00 = **18.6 cards**

Round up. You need to submit **19 cards** in a year to break even on a Standard membership.

For Premium membership:

$199 / ($32.99 - $24.99) = $199 / $8.00 = **24.9 cards**

That's **25 cards** to break even on Premium.

Sounds reasonable, right? Nineteen cards isn't that many if you're an active collector. But here's where the math gets honest.

### The costs nobody includes

That break-even number only works if grading fees are your only expense. They're not. Here's what a real submission actually costs:

**Shipping to PSA:**
- USPS Priority Mail (insured, tracked): $10 to $18 depending on weight and declared value
- FedEx or UPS (for higher-value submissions): $15 to $30

**Supplies per card:**
- Card Saver I or semi-rigid holder: ~$0.15 to $0.25
- Penny sleeve: ~$0.02
- Team bag for the lot: ~$0.10
- Bubble mailer or small box: $1 to $3

**Return shipping from PSA:**
- PSA charges for return shipping based on declared value and service level. Expect $10 to $25.

**Insurance:**
- If you're shipping cards worth real money, you're insuring them. USPS insurance on $500 of declared value runs about $5 to $8.

Let's be conservative and say your total overhead per submission (not per card) is about **$35 to $55** round trip, including supplies, shipping both ways, and basic insurance.

That doesn't change the per-card membership math directly, but it changes the ROI math on each individual card. And this is where people lose money.

### Realistic scenarios

**Scenario 1: You submit 20 cards in one batch, Standard membership**

| Line item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Membership | $149 |
| 20 cards x $24.99 | $499.80 |
| Shipping + supplies + return | ~$45 |
| **Total** | **~$693.80** |
| **Cost per card** | **~$34.69** |

Without membership, those same 20 cards at $32.99 each plus $45 in overhead would cost $704.80, or $35.24 per card.

Your savings: about **$11**. You just barely broke even. The membership paid for itself by the width of a penny sleeve.

**Scenario 2: You submit 40 cards in two batches, Standard membership**

| Line item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Membership | $149 |
| 40 cards x $24.99 | $999.60 |
| Shipping + supplies + return (2 batches) | ~$90 |
| **Total** | **~$1,238.60** |
| **Cost per card** | **~$30.97** |

Without membership: 40 x $32.99 + $90 = $1,409.60, or $35.24 per card.

Your savings: **$171**. Now we're talking. At 40 cards, the membership more than pays for itself and you're saving real money per slab.

**Scenario 3: You submit 10 cards, Standard membership**

| Line item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Membership | $149 |
| 10 cards x $24.99 | $249.90 |
| Shipping + supplies + return | ~$40 |
| **Total** | **~$438.90** |
| **Cost per card** | **~$43.89** |

Without membership: 10 x $32.99 + $40 = $369.90, or $36.99 per card.

You just **lost $69** by buying the membership. Ten cards isn't enough volume to justify $149.

The pattern is clear: below 19 cards per year, the membership costs you money. Above 25 cards, it starts saving you meaningful amounts. The sweet spot is 30+ cards per year, where the savings compound enough to matter.

## The grading ROI trap

Here's the part that's harder to talk about, because it means some of those thirty cards on my desk should never go to PSA in the first place.

The February 10 pricing change raised the floor. Not just the dollar floor (your cheapest option went from $20 to $24.99 or $32.99), but the *ROI floor*. The minimum raw card value where grading makes financial sense just went up.

Here's how I think about it now:

**The raw-price floor rule:** Don't submit a card to PSA unless the raw card is worth at least **$75 to $100**, AND you're confident it'll grade a **9.5 or 10**.

Why? Because at $25 per card for grading (plus your share of shipping and supplies, call it $30 all in), you need the graded version to sell for at least $30 more than the raw version to break even on the grading cost alone. And that only happens reliably when:

1. The card is valuable enough that a PSA 10 carries a meaningful premium over raw
2. You're confident enough in the grade that you're not rolling dice

A $40 raw modern hit that grades a PSA 9? You might get $50 to $55 for it graded. After $30 in grading costs, you lost money. You would have been better off selling it raw.

A $120 raw alt art that grades a PSA 10? Now you might be looking at $200 to $300+ graded. That's real ROI, and it's the only scenario where the math actually works.

For context on what cards are moving right now and what the price landscape looks like, check the **[TCGPlayer Price Trends (February 2026)](/posts/tcgplayer-price-trends-february-2026-pokemon-cards-climbing/)**.

### The PSA 9 problem

This is where modern Pokemon collectors get burned the most. Modern cards have generally excellent centering and print quality. A lot of them will grade PSA 9. And a PSA 9 on a modern card barely moves the needle.

The market pays a premium for PSA 10s. PSA 9s on modern cards trade at roughly the same price as raw near-mint copies. Sometimes less, because a raw card has "potential" and a PSA 9 is a confirmed "not perfect."

So when you're evaluating whether to submit, you're really asking: "Am I confident this is a 10?" If you're not, the honest answer is often to sell it raw and avoid the fee stack entirely.

## Decision tree: PSA vs BGS vs CGC in 2026

The membership question isn't just "is PSA Collectors Club worth it?" It's "should I even be submitting to PSA for this type of card?"

Here's the ladder I use:

**Step 1: What's your liquidity goal?**

If you want to flip graded cards quickly, PSA still commands the deepest market. More buyers know PSA, more sellers list PSA, the slabs move faster. For high-value singles you plan to sell within 6 months, PSA is still the default.

If you're holding long-term for your personal collection, the grading company matters less. Get the one you like looking at.

**Step 2: What's your grade probability?**

PSA 10-or-bust cards belong at PSA (the premium is highest there). If you're less certain and the card is in the $50 to $100 raw range, BGS might make more sense. A BGS 9.5 still commands a meaningful premium, and their subgrades give buyers more confidence. At roughly $30 per card for BGS Standard, the math is similar but the 9.5 outcome is less painful.

CGC at $15 per card is the budget play. If you're grading a stack of mid-range cards mostly for authentication and display, CGC gives you a slab for half the price. The resale premium is lower, but so is your risk.

For a full comparison of turnaround times and which service fits which situation, I wrote a deep dive here: **[Pokemon Card Grading Turnaround Times February 2026](/posts/pokemon-card-grading-turnaround-times-february-2026/)**. And for the fundamentals of each company, start here: **[How to Grade Pokemon Cards: PSA vs BGS vs CGC](/posts/how-to-grade-pokemon-cards-psa-vs-bgs-vs-cgc/)**.

**Step 3: What's your fee stack?**

Add it all up. Grading fee + membership (prorated per card if applicable) + shipping + supplies + insurance + return shipping + the time your capital is locked up for 7 to 11 weeks. That's your real cost. If the graded premium doesn't clear that number by at least 30%, it's not worth the hassle.

**Step 4: How many cards are you submitting this year?**

Under 15 cards: skip the PSA membership, use CGC or BGS for individual submissions, or use PSA's non-member Value tier for the cards that genuinely warrant a PSA slab.

15 to 25 cards: borderline. If you're consistently picking high-confidence 10 candidates, the Standard membership starts to pencil out. If your hit rate is uncertain, you might lose money on the membership.

25+ cards: the membership makes financial sense. At this volume, the $8 per card savings adds up fast, and you're likely experienced enough to be selective about what you submit.

## Buy, avoid, watch: your playbook after the price hike

**Buy (submit to PSA):**
- Cards worth $100+ raw where you're confident in a PSA 10 grade
- Vintage WOTC holos in genuinely clean condition (the PSA premium on vintage is still massive)
- Event promos and limited-distribution cards where authentication alone adds value
- If you're hitting 25+ submissions per year, the Collectors Club Standard membership

**Avoid:**
- Borderline modern cards in the $20 to $60 raw range (the fee stack eats your profit)
- Anything you suspect will grade PSA 9 or lower (sell it raw)
- Premium membership unless you're doing 30+ cards AND the extra benefits matter to you
- Submitting "just to see what it grades" on anything below the $75 raw floor

**Watch:**
- How PSA adjusts membership benefits over the next 6 months (they tend to iterate)
- BGS and CGC pricing in response (competition tends to follow)
- Your own submission data: track every card you grade, what it cost, what it sold for, and whether the membership actually saved you money after a full year

## FAQ

### How many cards do I need to submit to break even on PSA Collectors Club?

Nineteen cards for Standard ($149/year) and twenty-five cards for Premium ($199/year), based purely on the $8 per-card savings between member and non-member Value tiers. When you factor in shipping and supplies, you realistically want to be at 25+ cards to see meaningful savings.

### Is PSA Value Bulk the same thing as the old bulk grading service?

Not exactly. Value Bulk is PSA's current lowest-priced tier at $24.99 per card, but it requires Collectors Club membership. The old $20 Return tier (which was available to everyone) is gone. So "bulk pricing" now means "membership pricing."

### Does the Collectors Club discount apply immediately when I sign up?

You can submit at Value Bulk pricing as soon as your membership is active. There's no waiting period for the discount itself, though you'll still be subject to normal submission processing times for your actual cards.

### Should Pokemon collectors switch to BGS or CGC instead of PSA in 2026?

It depends on what you're grading and why. PSA still dominates resale liquidity for high-value singles. BGS offers a better deal on the 9.5 grade outcome, which matters for modern cards. CGC is the budget play at $15 per card for authentication and display. Most serious collectors end up using more than one service depending on the card. I break down when to use each one in **[How to Grade Pokemon Cards: PSA vs BGS vs CGC](/posts/how-to-grade-pokemon-cards-psa-vs-bgs-vs-cgc/)**.

### What raw card value makes PSA grading worth it in 2026?

My personal floor is $75 to $100 raw, with high confidence in a PSA 10 outcome. Below that, the grading fee stack ($25 to $35 all-in per card) eats too much of the potential upside. If you're not sure a card will grade a 10, sell it raw and put the grading money toward a card you're more confident about.

### Is the PSA Premium membership worth the extra $50 over Standard?

For most Pokemon collectors, no. The break-even jumps from 19 to 25 cards, and the extra benefits (additional grading credits, exclusive event access) only matter if you're already deep into the hobby. Standard gets you the pricing discount, which is the main reason to join.
