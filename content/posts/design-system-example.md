## Introduction

Welcome to **Colorful Cardboard**, where Pokemon nostalgia meets serious investment strategy. This post demonstrates our complete design system, including typography, color usage, and content structure.

This is an example of a **Market Analysis** post, which uses our premium purple color scheme. Each category has its own visual identity to help you quickly find the content you're looking for.

## Typography Showcase

### This is an H3 Heading (Space Grotesk)

Body text is set in Inter at 17px with a 1.7 line height for optimal readability. This size is larger than most blogs because we prioritize reading comfort for longer market analysis pieces.

**Bold text** stands out clearly for emphasis, while *italic text* can be used for card names or terms of art. Here's an example: The *Charizard VMAX* from *Darkness Ablaze* remains a strong investment play.

#### This is an H4 Heading

Smaller headings use reduced weight but maintain the Space Grotesk character. The hierarchy is clear and intentional.

## Color System in Action

Our five brand colors each serve a specific purpose:

1. **Electric Yellow** (#FFD93D) - Beginner-friendly content, learning resources
2. **Deep Blue** (#2B4C7E) - Primary brand color, main calls-to-action
3. **Cardinal Red** (#DC2626) - Hot picks, time-sensitive opportunities
4. **Emerald Green** (#059669) - Growth indicators, positive signals
5. **Royal Purple** (#8B5CF6) - Premium analysis, rare insights

Each category uses these colors strategically. Since this is a **Market Analysis** post, you'll see purple accents throughout, including the category badge at the top of this post.

## Lists and Structure

### Unordered Lists

Our investment thesis for 2026 includes:

- **Vintage sealed products** continue to appreciate
- **Alt art cards** from modern sets show strong demand
- **Graded PSA 10** premiums remain stable
- **Special sets** (like 151 and Prismatic Evolutions) outperform
- **Eeveelution cards** have consistent collector appeal

### Ordered Lists

Top 5 investment principles:

1. **Buy what you can afford to hold** for 5-10 years minimum
2. **Diversify across eras** (vintage, ex-era, modern)
3. **Prioritize condition** - PSA 9-10 for modern, PSA 7-8 for vintage
4. **Follow the data** - use price tracking tools
5. **Understand print runs** - scarcity drives value

## Blockquotes and Emphasis

Investment advice from the Pokemon TCG community:

> "The best time to invest in Pokemon cards was 10 years ago. The second best time is now. But only if you're buying with a long-term strategy and understanding the risks."
> 
> — r/PokeInvesting community wisdom

This perfectly captures our philosophy at Colorful Cardboard. We're not about quick flips or get-rich-quick schemes. We're about building lasting value through strategic collecting.

  "number": "4/102",

- **Featured image**: 1200x630px for social sharing
- **Card photos**: High quality, centered, consistent lighting

## Responsive Design Notes

This design system works beautifully across all devices:

- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Full two-column layout, sidebar table of contents
- **Tablet (768-1023px)**: Optimized spacing, touch-friendly targets
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Single column, reduced heading sizes, hamburger menu

The typography scales down appropriately, and touch targets remain a minimum of 44x44px for accessibility.

---

## Dark Mode Support

This entire design system works in dark mode! Toggle the theme switch in the header to see the transformation:

- Background shifts to Slate 900
- Text becomes Slate 100 (not harsh pure white)
- Accent colors adjust for better contrast
- Category colors maintain their identity
- Shadows deepen for proper depth

---

## Accessibility Features

Every design decision prioritizes accessibility:

- **Color contrast**: All text meets WCAG AA standards (most meet AAA)
- **Focus states**: Visible keyboard navigation indicators
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- **Alt text**: All images include descriptive alternatives
- **Font sizing**: Base 17px for comfortable reading
- **Line spacing**: 1.7 line-height reduces eye strain

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read the full design spec** (`DESIGN-SPEC.md`) for detailed guidelines
2. **Check the implementation guide** (`IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`) for setup steps
