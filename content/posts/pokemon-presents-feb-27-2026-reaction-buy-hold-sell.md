Pokémon Presents just ended. Here's what was announced and what it means for your collection.

**The headline:** Gen 10 is real. **Pokémon Wind and Wave** is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2027. New starters have been revealed. Official art is already circulating.

Also confirmed: **Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness** hits Nintendo Switch Online in March 2026.

Community reaction is mixed — some were hoping for more, no FireRed/LeafGreen remake was announced, no "Eternals" 30th anniversary set confirmed. But for TCG investors, Wind and Wave is the signal that matters.

Here's the breakdown on what it all means for your money.

## BUY Right Now

### Paldean Fates and 151 Sealed — Conviction Just Got Stronger

Gen 10 announcement plus nostalgia energy from a 30th anniversary year equals new players entering the game. New players always gravitate toward classic Pokémon. 151 and Paldean Fates (loaded with beloved original designs) are exactly what those new collectors chase first.

And the rotation cliff still hits April 10. That hasn't changed. These sets are on a countdown regardless of any announcement. The window to buy at current prices is closing fast.

If you're sitting on cash and haven't moved yet — this is the moment. Buy at MSRP or close to it.

### First Partner Illustration Collections (March 30) — Upgrade to HIGH Conviction

Original starters. 30th anniversary year. Wind and Wave just confirmed a new generation launching in 2027, which means the next 12-18 months are a nostalgia super-cycle. Gen 1 starters are the most recognizable Pokémon on earth.

First Partner Illustration Collections drop March 30 with OG starter Illustration Rares in limited distribution. The demand signal from today's Presents just got stronger. Pre-order at MSRP if you can find it.

This is no longer a "reasonable" play. High conviction.

## HOLD Right Now

### Ascended Heroes — Wait 48-72 Hours

Don't make fast moves on Ascended Heroes in the next 24 hours. Post-Presents hype creates a predictable pattern: speculative buyers flood secondary market immediately, then flush out within 48 hours as excitement settles.

The Walmart+ restock at $59.99 is still your rational entry if you haven't touched this set. Don't pay $120+ secondary market when retail restocks exist.

Already in? Hold. Nothing announced today directly impacts Ascended Heroes.

### Perfect Order (March 27) — Still the Patient Play

Smallest Scarlet & Violet set ever means concentrated chase cards and better pack odds. Nothing today changes this. Pre-order at MSRP when available.

### Wind and Wave TCG Speculation — Way Too Early

New starters are revealed and speculation is already flying. Don't touch any "Wind and Wave anticipation" buys. The game doesn't release until 2027. TCG sets follow the game, not precede it by a year. No product exists yet and anyone pitching Wind and Wave speculation picks right now is early. Wait until official TCG product is announced.

## SELL — Or At Least Don't Buy More

### Rotating Singles — Move Them Into the Hype

April 10 rotation is 42 days away. Standard-playable singles from SV Base, Paldea Evolved, Obsidian Flames, Paradox Rift, Paldean Fates, and 151 will lose 30-50% of their competitive price floor when Standard demand drops.

Sell into the Presents excitement while buyers are hyped. Secondary market prices peak during announcement windows. Mid-tier playables from rotating sets should be moving now, not after rotation.

Chase arts and popular collector cards will recover. The bulk stuff won't.

### Pokémon Day 2026 Collection Box

Mass produced. The 3-pack plus Pikachu promo format never holds value. Skip.

## The Pattern to Watch This Week

Post-Presents prices follow a predictable arc:

1. **Today (9AM-3PM):** Speculative spike. Prices up across the board.
2. **Days 2-3 (Sat-Sun):** Flush. Early buyers take profit, secondary market floods. Some deals appear.
3. **Week 2 (Mar 3-7):** Sustained climb on confirmed winners. Often the cleaner entry.

If you missed [yesterday's pre-Presents buying window](/posts/what-to-buy-before-pokemon-presents-feb-27-2026/), the week-after entry on confirmed plays (Fates, 151, First Partner) is usually cleaner than day-of secondary market pricing.

## Bottom Line

Wind and Wave for Switch 2 in 2027 is the real news. Gen 10 confirmed. New starters out. We're officially in a 30th anniversary nostalgia super-cycle that runs through 2027.

The rotation cliff on April 10 was already the dominant story. Today's Presents reinforces the Paldean Fates and 151 buy thesis, upgrades First Partner Illustration Collections to high conviction, and doesn't materially change anything else.
