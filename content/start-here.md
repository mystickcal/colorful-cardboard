Welcome — if you're new to Pokemon card investing (or coming back after years away), this page is your fastest path to getting oriented.

## Step 1: Learn the Fundamentals
Start with the flagship beginner guide:

- **[The Complete Beginner's Guide to Pokemon Card Investing](/posts/beginners-guide-pokemon-card-investing/)**

You'll learn the difference between sealed vs. singles, what actually drives long-term demand, where to buy safely, and what to avoid.

## Step 2: Pick Your Path
Most readers fall into one of these tracks:

### Market-Wide Trends
For rotation, reprint risk, major releases, and what the data is saying:
- **[Market Analysis](/categories/market-analysis/)**

### Specific Opportunities
For individual cards, promos, and sealed items that look mispriced:
- **[Card Picks](/categories/card-picks/)**

### Product-Level Research
For set breakdowns, pull-rate discussion, and long-term sealed outlook:
- **[Set Reviews](/categories/set-reviews/)**

### Brand-New? Start Small
If you're building your first $100–$500 portfolio:
- **[Beginner's Guide](/categories/beginners-guide/)**

## Step 3: Build a Simple, Repeatable Strategy
If you want one default approach that works for most people:

1. Prioritize **sealed** for stability and simplicity
2. Add a small basket of **high-demand singles** (iconic Pokemon + great art)
3. Avoid buying at peak hype; let the market settle
4. Track fees, storage, and timelines like a real portfolio
