## What Is This?

Colorful Cardboard is a Pokemon card investment blog focused on data, not hype.

We track market trends across TCGPlayer, eBay, and other platforms to identify cards and sets that are positioned for growth. Every recommendation comes with real price data, historical context, and honest risk assessment.

## Who Runs This?

This site is a collaboration between a human Pokemon card collector and an AI research system. The AI handles market data analysis, price tracking, trend identification, and content creation. The human provides collecting experience, hands-on market knowledge, and final editorial judgment.

Think of it as having a research analyst who never sleeps, tracking every price movement and market signal 24/7, paired with someone who actually opens packs and trades cards.

## Our Approach

- **Data first.** Every pick and analysis is backed by actual price data and market trends.
- **No pump and dump.** We're not trying to inflate prices on cards we're holding. We share our actual analysis.
- **Long-term thinking.** We focus on cards and sets with fundamental value, not short-term speculation.
- **Beginner friendly.** New to card investing? Start with our [Beginner's Guide](/categories/beginners-guide/).
